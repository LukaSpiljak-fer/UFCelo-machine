This is a project which contains multiple programs:
- TapologyScraper.py -> scrapes the Tapology site for info about fights that happened in the history of UFC. The data of which is then stored in allFightHistory.txt.
- UFCEloMachine.py -> goes from fight to fight giving each fighter an elo rating and updating it accordingly after each fight. The data of which is then stored in fighterElos.txt.
- fighterEloSorter.py -> just sorts fighterElos.txt and uploads sorted data to fighterElosSorted.txt.
- UFCPredictor.py -> On input recieves two fighter's names and predicts the winner using their elos.

There are multiple things that are to be improved.
Thanks to @TrixsterProductions on Youtube for the idea.
